# Indian-Flag-JS
# Indian Flag with Waving Animation using JavaScript

This project uses JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas to render an animated, waving Indian flag. The flag displays the three bands of saffron, white, and green with the Ashoka Chakra in the center. The animation effect gives the impression of the flag waving in the wind, enhancing the visual experience.

## Features

- **Canvas Drawing**: The Indian flag is drawn entirely on an HTML5 Canvas element.
- **Waving Animation**: CSS and JavaScript are used to simulate a waving effect, giving the flag a lifelike appearance.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts the canvas size based on the device’s screen for an optimal viewing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Used to draw the flag and animate it.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Provides the drawing context for rendering the flag.
- **CSS**: Adds additional styling for layout and animation.

## File Structure

- `flag.html` - Main HTML file.
- `flag.css` - CSS file for styling and animation.

## Code Explanation

### HTML
The HTML file contains a `<canvas>` element, which serves as the drawing surface for the flag.

### JavaScript (flag.js)
1. **Flag Drawing**: Uses canvas APIs to draw three horizontal stripes and a circle in the center for the Ashoka Chakra.
2. **Waving Animation**: A simple wave animation is applied by dynamically adjusting the flag’s position and shape.

### CSS (flag.css)
The CSS file contains styles for positioning the canvas and applying additional animation effects.

## Usage

- Open the project in a browser to view the animated flag.
- To adjust the flag size or animation speed, modify the canvas dimensions or JavaScript values.

## Acknowledgments
